# Brazilian ETFs Risk analysis
We are concerned about comparing two important Brazilian ETFs regarding a risk-reward analysis, a large-cap ETF (BOVA11), and a small-cap ETF (SMAL11).
We're using statistics and financial math to assess the correlation and risk-adjusted return of both assets. Whether or not to keep both of them in your portfolio will be worth it or it had better pick up one of them. In that case, what should you choose?
